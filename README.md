# Archivist

This is a small project to wrangle Magic cards and maybe, just maybe, build something useful with SvelteKit and maybe (even more so) ElysiaJS. 

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
bun run -b dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun --bun run build
```

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
